Just Completed: Interactive Chessboard Web App (Text-Based Moves) ♟️🖥️
I'm excited to share a project I recently built — a fully functional chessboard web application where players make moves using keyboard input instead of drag-and-drop!
🚀 Features:
 ✅ Dynamic 8x8 chessboard using HTML, CSS Grid
 ✅ Enter moves like e2 e4 and see pieces move in real time
 ✅ Turn-based logic (White → Black)
 ✅ Move validation with the chess.js library (no illegal moves!)
 ✅ Check, Checkmate, and Draw detection
 ✅ Undo last move functionality
 ✅ Live move history tracking
💡 This was a fun way to combine DOM manipulation with game logic while enhancing keyboard accessibility for chess players.

Big thanks to the open-source community behind chess.js for making rule validation so easy to implement!
